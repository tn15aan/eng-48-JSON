# JSON Basics

## JSON Definition
JavaScript Object Notation
--> is usually a **Dictionary**

However, confusingly an object in JS is the Data Type
for both Lists (Arrays) and Dictionaries (Hash)

## Create a JSON file

## Make POST Request with JSON
you need:
- path
- json
- headers

## Task
Make a small program that requests 3 postcodes and returns something
like:
'''
   > 1 - Postcode: xyzpto with nhs location at: xyx
   > 2 - Postcode: xyzpto2 with nhs location at: xyx
   > 3 - (....)
'''
